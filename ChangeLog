List of changes between releases of Extension:JsCalendar.

== master branch (will become JsCalendar 0.3.4 or 0.4.0, depending on magnitude of changes) ==

Features:
* Added an option to use FullCalendar 5 (most current version) instead of FullCalendar 2.9.1.
	This is experimental, because the styling of v5 calendar is preliminary and may be changed later.
	Can be enabled with $wgJsCalendarFullCalendarVersion = 5;
* titleRegex= parameter can now be configured to retrieve the end date of the multiday event
	if it has the end date in the title of its page.
* Leading/trailing symbols `:` and `/` (common delimiters) are trimmed away from the visible event names.
* Added "height" parameter to set the height of calendar (in pixels) explicitly,
	as an alternative to default (automatically chosen height) and to "aspectratio" parameter.
* symbols= parameter now works on wikis with $wgCompressRevisions=true.

Bugfixes:
* "aspectratio" parameter is no longer ignored.
